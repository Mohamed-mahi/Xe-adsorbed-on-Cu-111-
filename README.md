## About
This repository contains a Python implementation of a parameterized model developed by Righi and Ferrario in their 2007 paper. The model describes the interaction potential between rare gases and a copper surface. 

## Features
- Construction of the Potential Energy Surface (PES)
- Extension of the model using the Potential Function and Forces to integrate the equation of motion
- Generation of trajectories from a common origin
- Calculation of the diffusion coefficient

## Methodology
The model parameters are derived on the basis of ab initio calculations, as described in the original paper by Righi and Ferrario.

## Usage
To use this code:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the main script to perform simulations and calculate the diffusion coefficient.
